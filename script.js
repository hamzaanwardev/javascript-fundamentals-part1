// Conventions for variable name
// let new = "saad";   //we can not use word new as variable name because this word is specified in JavaScript.
// let function = 'jamal'; //we can not use word function as variable name because this word is specified in JavaScript.
// let 3years = '2015' + '2016' + '2017';  //we can not use number as first letter in variable name.

// We can use $, _, camelcase, number after any alphabet as variable name. 


// Always use relevent variable names with respect to its value. so everyone can understand easily
// Here we can understand my FirstJob and myCurrentJob.
let myFirstJob = 'Mercahnt Navy Oficer';
let myCurrentJob = 'Programmer';

// Not Relevant because we don't know what is job1 and job2.
let job1 = "Mercant Navy Officer";
let job2 = "Programmer";

// JavaScript VAriables
// three types of variables 1. let  2. var  3. Const. MOstly used let and const because var is too old.
firstName = "Muhammad";
console.log(firstName);
